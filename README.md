## Introduction

Luna Bay Resort currently lacks an integrated system for managing its various services, which include food services, swimming areas, cottages, and equipment rentals. Manual processes for bookings, billing, scheduling, and maintenance tracking lead to inefficiencies and potential errors. This management application seeks to address these challenges by providing a unified system for financial tracking, booking management, scheduling, and a point-of-sale (POS) system.

The **Luna Bay Resort App** aims to enhance the operational efficiency of the resort by automating and organizing daily tasks, freeing up staff time for higher-value activities and providing a smoother experience for guests. Resort employees can easily manage inventory, monitor financial transactions, and oversee maintenance tasks, leading to better time management, reduced errors, and improved customer satisfaction.
